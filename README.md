# Modern Portfolio

Modern responsive portfolio layout.

- Minimal JavaScript, used to open close menu.
- NPM used to run SASS and deploy using GH-Pages (package.json file modified with scripts to allow commands to run properly).
- Advanced SASS features used such as @content, @extend, @function, @if, @else, @return ... etc

I like the look and feel, may use this for my own portfolio. Originally did this project off of a youttube demo from Traversy Media to learn more advanced SASS functionality.
